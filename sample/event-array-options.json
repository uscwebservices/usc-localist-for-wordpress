Feel free to bring your own mat, block or other materials.\n\n \n\nLita Albuquerque, 20/20: Accelerando\n\nIn 20/20: Accelerando, Albuquerque merges film, sound and performance to tell the story of a 25th century female astronaut who lands on Earth in the year 6,000 BC with a mission to seed interstellar consciousness on the planet. Upon entering Earth’s atmosphere, she forgets her mission: “Where was I? And why was I awakening at this moment, on this planet?”\n\nHer traumatic forgetting, followed by remembrance, dramatizes both who we are and who we may become. A complex gesture of adaptation, 20/20: Accelerando emerges from GenIus Remembered, a narrative text Albuquerque began writing in 2003 and continues to develop. Dynamically transforming and activating the entire museum, Albuquerque fractures her own narrative into impressionistic passages. Arrayed throughout the galleries, her imagery carries the viewer out of the everyday and into a space of wonderment, triggering memory and mystery. Working in close collaboration with the artist Robbie C. Williamson, who also composed original scores for the film and performance, the installations trace complex metaphors of space, loss and community – pillars that have long anchored Albuquerque’s practice.",
